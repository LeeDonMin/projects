I’m particularly proud of the fact that one of my students fired Sam Altman.”\\n\\nOf course, Hinton is referring to OpenAI’s board voting to fire Altman in November 2023. Sutskever delivered the news to Altman via video call, but later said he regretted it. Hinton seems to have celebrated the firing of OpenAI’s CEO as a win for AI safety, which he often advocates for. However, the win was short-lived, as Altman now has more control over OpenAI than before, and he could soon get equity.\\n\\nTopics:\\n\\nTC\\n\\nAI\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tElon Musk unveils the Robovan: the biggest surprise from Tesla’s We, Robot event\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRebecca Bellan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMaxwell Zeff\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t2 hours ago\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTesla reveals 20 Cybercabs at We, Robot event, says you’ll be able to buy one for less than $30,000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRebecca Bellan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t2 hours ago\\n\\nIn Brief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFTX’s Ryan Salame posts jokes on LinkedIn as he heads to prison\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAmanda Silberling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t10 hours ago\\n\\nLatest in AI\\n\\nSee More\\n\\nApps\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBabbel co-founder Markus Witte will once again run the company, replacing CEO Arne Schepker\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFrederic Lardinois\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t5 hours ago\\n\\nEnterprise\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNumeric grabs $28M Series A to automate accounting using AI\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMarina Temkin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t15 hours ago\\n\\nIn Brief\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSomeone claims to have used AI to apply to 2,843 jobs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA reporter used AI to apply to 2,843 jobs\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKyle Wiggers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t16 hours ago '"

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/08/the-week-in-ai-generative-ai-spams-up-the-web/'}, page_content='Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as\\xa0AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.\\n\\nThis week, SpeedyBrand, a company using generative AI to create SEO-optimized content, emerged from stealth with backing from Y Combinator. It hasn’t attracted a lot of funding yet ($2.5 million), and its customer base is relatively small (about 50 brands). But it got me thinking about how generative AI is beginning to change the makeup of the web.\\n\\nAs The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent\\xa0piece, generative AI models are making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. NewsGuard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has exposed\\xa0hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.\\n\\nIt’s causing a problem for advertisers. Many of the sites spotlighted by NewsGuard seem exclusively built to abuse programmatic advertising, or the automated systems for putting ads on pages. In its report, NewsGuard found close to 400 instances of ads from 141 major brands that appeared on 55 of the junk news sites.\\n\\nIt’s not just advertisers who should be worried. As Gizmodo’s Kyle Barr points out, it might just take one AI-generated article to drive mountains of engagement. And even if every AI-generated article only generates a few dollars, that’s less than the cost of generating the text in the first place — and potential advertising money not being sent to legitimate sites.\\n\\nSo what’s the solution? Is there one? It’s a pair of questions that’s increasingly keeping me up at night. Barr suggests it’s incumbent on search engines and ad platforms to exercise a tighter grip and punish the bad actors embracing generative AI. But given how fast the field is moving — and the infinitely scalable nature of generative AI — I’m not convinced that they can keep up.\\n\\nOf course, spammy content isn’t a new phenomenon, and there’s been waves before. The web has adapted. What’s different this time is that the barrier to entry is dramatically low — both in terms of the cost and time that has to be invested.\\n\\nVincent strikes an optimistic tone, implying that if the web is\\xa0eventually overrun with AI junk, it could spur the development of better-funded platforms. I’m not so sure. What’s not in doubt, though, is that we’re at an inflection point, and that the decisions made now around generative AI and its outputs will impact the function of the web for some time to come.\\n\\nHere are other AI stories of note from the past few days:\\n\\nOpenAI officially launches GPT-4: OpenAI this week announced\\xa0the general availability of\\xa0GPT-4, its latest text-generating model, through its paid API. GPT-4 can generate text (including code) and accept image and text inputs — an improvement over GPT-3.5, its predecessor, which only accepted text — and performs at “human level” on various professional and academic benchmarks. But it’s not perfect, as we note in our previous coverage. (Meanwhile ChatGPT adoption is reported to be down, but we’ll see.)\\n\\nBringing ‘superintelligent’ AI under control: In other OpenAI news, the company is forming a new team led by Ilya Sutskever, its chief scientist and one of OpenAI’s co-founders, to develop ways to steer and control “superintelligent” AI systems.\\n\\nAnti-bias law for NYC: After months of delays, New York City this week began enforcing a law that requires employers using algorithms to recruit, hire or promote employees to submit those algorithms for an independent audit — and make the results public.\\n\\nValve tacitly greenlights AI-generated games: Valve issued a rare statement after claims it was rejecting games with AI-generated assets from its Steam games store. The notoriously close-lipped developer said its policy was evolving and not a stand against AI.\\n\\nHumane unveils the Ai Pin: Humane, the startup launched by ex-Apple design and engineering duo Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, this week revealed details about its first product: The Ai Pin. As it turns out, Humane’s product is a wearable gadget with a projected display and AI-powered features — like a futuristic smartphone, but in a vastly different form factor.\\n\\nWarnings over EU AI regulation: Major tech founders, CEOs, VCs and industry giants across Europe signed an open letter to the EU Commission this week, warning that Europe could miss out on the generative AI revolution if the EU passes laws stifling innovation.\\n\\nDeepfake scam makes the rounds: Check out\\xa0this clip of U.K. consumer finance champion Martin Lewis apparently shilling an investment opportunity backed by Elon Musk. Seems normal, right? Not exactly. It’s an AI-generated deepfake — and potentially a glimpse of the AI-generated misery fast accelerating onto our screens.\\n\\nAI-powered sex toys: Lovense — perhaps best known for its remote-controllable sex toys — this week announced its ChatGPT Pleasure Companion. Launched in beta in the company’s remote control app, the “Advanced Lovense ChatGPT Pleasure Companion” invites you to indulge in juicy and erotic stories that the Companion creates based on your selected topic.\\n\\nOther machine learnings\\n\\nOur research roundup commences with two very different projects from ETH Zurich. First is aiEndoscopic, a smart intubation spinoff. Intubation is necessary for a patient’s survival in many circumstances, but it’s a tricky manual procedure usually performed by specialists. The intuBot uses computer vision to recognize and respond to a live feed from the mouth and throat, guiding and correcting the position of the endoscope. This could allow people to safely intubate when needed rather than waiting on the specialist, potentially saving lives.\\n\\nHere’s them explaining it in a little more detail:\\n\\nIn a totally different domain, ETH Zurich researchers also contributed second-hand to a Pixar movie by pioneering the technology needed to animate smoke and fire without falling prey to the fractal complexity of fluid dynamics. Their approach was noticed and built on by Disney and Pixar for the film “Elemental.” Interestingly, it’s not so much a simulation solution as a style transfer one — a clever and apparently quite valuable shortcut. (Image up top is from this.)\\n\\nAI in nature is always interesting, but nature AI as applied to archaeology is even more so. Research led by Yamagata University aimed to identify new Nasca lines — the enormous “geoglyphs” in Peru. You might think that, being visible from orbit, they’d be pretty obvious — but erosion and tree cover from the millennia since these mysterious formations were created mean there are an unknown number hiding just out of sight. After being trained on aerial imagery of known and obscured geoglyphs, a deep learning model was set free on other views, and amazingly it detected at least four new ones, as you can see below. Pretty exciting!\\n\\nIn a more immediately relevant sense, AI-adjacent tech is always finding new work detecting and predicting natural disasters. Stanford engineers are putting together data to train future wildfire prediction models by performing simulations of heated air above a forest canopy in a 30-foot water tank. If we’re to model the physics of flames and embers traveling outside the bounds of a wildfire, we’ll need to understand them better, and this team is doing what they can to approximate that.\\n\\nAt UCLA they’re looking into how to predict landslides, which are more common as fires and other environmental factors change. But while AI has already been used to predict them with some success, it doesn’t “show its work,” meaning a prediction doesn’t explain whether it’s because of erosion, or a water table shifting, or tectonic activity. A new “superposable neural network” approach has the layers of the network using different data but running in parallel rather than all together, letting the output be a little more specific in which variables led to increased risk. It’s also way more efficient.\\n\\nGoogle is looking at an interesting challenge: How do you get a machine learning system to learn from dangerous knowledge yet not propagate it? For instance, if its training set includes the recipe for napalm, you don’t want it to repeat it — but in order to know not to repeat it, it needs to know what it’s not repeating. A paradox! So the tech giant is looking for a method of “machine unlearning” that lets this sort of balancing act occur safely and reliably.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for a deeper look at why people seem to trust AI models for no good reason, look no further than this Science editorial by Celeste Kidd (UC Berkeley) and Abeba Birhane (Mozilla). It gets into the psychological underpinnings of trust and authority and shows how current AI agents basically use those as springboards to escalate their own worth. It’s a really interesting article if you want to sound smart this weekend.\\n\\nThough we often hear about the infamous Mechanical Turk fake chess-playing machine, that charade did inspire people to create what it pretended to be. IEEE Spectrum has a fascinating story about the Spanish physicist and engineer Torres Quevedo, who created an actual mechanical chess player. Its capabilities were limited, but that’s how you know it was real. Some even propose that his chess machine was the first “computer game.” Food for thought.\\n\\nTopics\\n\\nAI\\n\\nAI\\n\\nnewsletter\\n\\nthis week in AI\\n\\nthis week in ai newsletter\\n\\nMost Popular\\n\\nElon Musk unveils the Robovan: the biggest surprise from Tesla’s We, Robot event\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nRebecca Bellan\\nMaxwell Zeff\\n\\nTesla reveals 20 Cybercabs at We, Robot event, says you’ll be able to buy one for less than $30,000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nRebecca Bellan\\n\\nAmazon team in charge of Just Walk Out loses three execs, gains one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nMaxwell Zeff\\n\\nFTX’s Ryan Salame posts jokes on LinkedIn as he heads to prison\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nAmanda Silberling\\n\\nBluesky joins Threads to court users frustrated by Meta’s moderation issues\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nSarah Perez\\n\\nNumeric grabs $28M Series A to automate accounting using AI\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nMarina Temkin\\n\\nKyle Wiggers\\n\\nSenior Reporter, Enterprise\\n\\n@Kyle_L_Wiggers\\n\\nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

       "'Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as\\xa0AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.\\n\\nThis week, SpeedyBrand, a company using generative AI to create SEO-optimized content, emerged from stealth with backing from Y Combinator. It hasn’t attracted a lot of funding yet ($2.5 million), and its customer base is relatively small (about 50 brands). But it got me thinking about how generative AI is beginning to change the makeup of the web.\\n\\nAs The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent\\xa0piece, generative AI models are making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. NewsGuard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has exposed\\xa0hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.\\n\\nIt’s causing a problem for advertisers. Many of the sites spotlighted by NewsGuard seem exclusively built to abuse programmatic advertising, or the automated systems for putting ads on pages. In its report, NewsGuard found close to 400 instances of ads from 141 major brands that appeared on 55 of the junk news sites.\\n\\nIt’s not just advertisers who should be worried. As Gizmodo’s Kyle Barr points out, it might just take one AI-generated article to drive mountains of engagement. And even if every AI-generated article only generates a few dollars, that’s less than the cost of generating the text in the first place — and potential advertising money not being sent to legitimate sites.\\n\\nSo what’s the solution? Is there one? It’s a pair of questions that’s increasingly keeping me up at night. Barr suggests it’s incumbent on search engines and ad platforms to exercise a tighter grip and punish the bad actors embracing generative AI. But given how fast the field is moving — and the infinitely scalable nature of generative AI — I’m not convinced that they can keep up.\\n\\nOf course, spammy content isn’t a new phenomenon, and there’s been waves before. The web has adapted. What’s different this time is that the barrier to entry is dramatically low — both in terms of the cost and time that has to be invested.\\n\\nVincent strikes an optimistic tone, implying that if the web is\\xa0eventually overrun with AI junk, it could spur the development of better-funded platforms. I’m not so sure. What’s not in doubt, though, is that we’re at an inflection point, and that the decisions made now around generative AI and its outputs will impact the function of the web for some time to come.\\n\\nHere are other AI stories of note from the past few days:\\n\\nOpenAI officially launches GPT-4: OpenAI this week announced\\xa0the general availability of\\xa0GPT-4, its latest text-generating model, through its paid API. GPT-4 can generate text (including code) and accept image and text inputs — an improvement over GPT-3.5, its predecessor, which only accepted text — and performs at “human level” on various professional and academic benchmarks. But it’s not perfect, as we note in our previous coverage. (Meanwhile ChatGPT adoption is reported to be down, but we’ll see.)\\n\\nBringing ‘superintelligent’ AI under control: In other OpenAI news, the company is forming a new team led by Ilya Sutskever, its chief scientist and one of OpenAI’s co-founders, to develop ways to steer and control “superintelligent” AI systems.\\n\\nAnti-bias law for NYC: After months of delays, New York City this week began enforcing a law that requires employers using algorithms to recruit, hire or promote employees to submit those algorithms for an independent audit — and make the results public.\\n\\nValve tacitly greenlights AI-generated games: Valve issued a rare statement after claims it was rejecting games with AI-generated assets from its Steam games store. The notoriously close-lipped developer said its policy was evolving and not a stand against AI.\\n\\nHumane unveils the Ai Pin: Humane, the startup launched by ex-Apple design and engineering duo Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, this week revealed details about its first product: The Ai Pin. As it turns out, Humane’s product is a wearable gadget with a projected display and AI-powered features — like a futuristic smartphone, but in a vastly different form factor.\\n\\nWarnings over EU AI regulation: Major tech founders, CEOs, VCs and industry giants across Europe signed an open letter to the EU Commission this week, warning that Europe could miss out on the generative AI revolution if the EU passes laws stifling innovation.\\n\\nDeepfake scam makes the rounds: Check out\\xa0this clip of U.K. consumer finance champion Martin Lewis apparently shilling an investment opportunity backed by Elon Musk. Seems normal, right? Not exactly. It’s an AI-generated deepfake — and potentially a glimpse of the AI-generated misery fast accelerating onto our screens.\\n\\nAI-powered sex toys: Lovense — perhaps best known for its remote-controllable sex toys — this week announced its ChatGPT Pleasure Companion. Launched in beta in the company’s remote control app, the “Advanced Lovense ChatGPT Pleasure Companion” invites you to indulge in juicy and erotic stories that the Companion creates based on your selected topic.\\n\\nOther machine learnings\\n\\nOur research roundup commences with two very different projects from ETH Zurich. First is aiEndoscopic, a smart intubation spinoff. Intubation is necessary for a patient’s survival in many circumstances, but it’s a tricky manual procedure usually performed by specialists. The intuBot uses computer vision to recognize and respond to a live feed from the mouth and throat, guiding and correcting the position of the endoscope. This could allow people to safely intubate when needed rather than waiting on the specialist, potentially saving lives.\\n\\nHere’s them explaining it in a little more detail:\\n\\nIn a totally different domain, ETH Zurich researchers also contributed second-hand to a Pixar movie by pioneering the technology needed to animate smoke and fire without falling prey to the fractal complexity of fluid dynamics. Their approach was noticed and built on by Disney and Pixar for the film “Elemental.” Interestingly, it’s not so much a simulation solution as a style transfer one — a clever and apparently quite valuable shortcut. (Image up top is from this.)\\n\\nAI in nature is always interesting, but nature AI as applied to archaeology is even more so. Research led by Yamagata University aimed to identify new Nasca lines — the enormous “geoglyphs” in Peru. You might think that, being visible from orbit, they’d be pretty obvious — but erosion and tree cover from the millennia since these mysterious formations were created mean there are an unknown number hiding just out of sight. After being trained on aerial imagery of known and obscured geoglyphs, a deep learning model was set free on other views, and amazingly it detected at least four new ones, as you can see below. Pretty exciting!\\n\\nIn a more immediately relevant sense, AI-adjacent tech is always finding new work detecting and predicting natural disasters. Stanford engineers are putting together data to train future wildfire prediction models by performing simulations of heated air above a forest canopy in a 30-foot water tank. If we’re to model the physics of flames and embers traveling outside the bounds of a wildfire, we’ll need to understand them better, and this team is doing what they can to approximate that.\\n\\nAt UCLA they’re looking into how to predict landslides, which are more common as fires and other environmental factors change. But while AI has already been used to predict them with some success, it doesn’t “show its work,” meaning a prediction doesn’t explain whether it’s because of erosion, or a water table shifting, or tectonic activity. A new “superposable neural network” approach has the layers of the network using different data but running in parallel rather than all together, letting the output be a little more specific in which variables led to increased risk. It’s also way more efficient.\\n\\nGoogle is looking at an interesting challenge: How do you get a machine learning system to learn from dangerous knowledge yet not propagate it? For instance, if its training set includes the recipe for napalm, you don’t want it to repeat it — but in order to know not to repeat it, it needs to know what it’s not repeating. A paradox! So the tech giant is looking for a method of “machine unlearning” that lets this sort of balancing act occur safely and reliably.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for a deeper look at why people seem to trust AI models for no good reason, look no further than this Science editorial by Celeste Kidd (UC Berkeley) and Abeba Birhane (Mozilla). It gets into the psychological underpinnings of trust and authority and shows how current AI agents basically use those as springboards to escalate their own worth. It’s a really interesting article if you want to sound smart this weekend.\\n\\nThough we often hear about the infamous Mechanical Turk fake chess-playing machine, that charade did inspire people to create what it pretended to be. IEEE Spectrum has a fascinating story about the Spanish physicist and engineer Torres Quevedo, who created an actual mechanical chess player. Its capabilities were limited, but that’s how you know it was real. Some even propose that his chess machine was the first “computer game.” Food for thought.\\n\\nTopics\\n\\nAI\\n\\nAI\\n\\nnewsletter\\n\\nthis week in AI\\n\\nthis week in ai newsletter\\n\\nMost Popular\\n\\nElon Musk unveils the Robovan: the biggest surprise from Tesla’s We, Robot event\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nRebecca Bellan\\nMaxwell Zeff\\n\\nTesla reveals 20 Cybercabs at We, Robot event, says you’ll be able to buy one for less than $30,000\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nRebecca Bellan\\n\\nAmazon team in charge of Just Walk Out loses three execs, gains one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nMaxwell Zeff\\n\\nFTX’s Ryan Salame posts jokes on LinkedIn as he heads to prison\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nAmanda Silberling\\n\\nBluesky joins Threads to court users frustrated by Meta’s moderation issues\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nSarah Perez\\n\\nNumeric grabs $28M Series A to automate accounting using AI\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nMarina Temkin\\n\\nKyle Wiggers\\n\\nSenior Reporter, Enterprise\\n\\n@Kyle_L_Wiggers\\n\\nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

Sutskever는 영상 통화를 통해 Altman에게 이 소식을 전달했지만 나중에 후회한다고 말했습니다. Hinton은 OpenAI CEO의 해임을 자신이 자주 옹호하는 AI 안전의 승리로 축하한 것으로 보입니다. 그러나 Altman은 이제 이전보다 OpenAI에 대한 더 많은 통제권을 갖게 되었고 곧 지분을 확보할 수 있게 되었기 때문에 승리는 오래 가지 못했습니다.\\n\\n주제:\\n\\nTC\\n\\n일체 포함\\n\\n관련된\\n\\n운송\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tElon Musk는 Tesla의 We, Robot 이벤트에서 가장 놀라운 제품인 Robovan을 공개했습니다.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t레베카 벨란\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t맥스웰 제프\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t2시간 전\\n\\n운송\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTesla는 We, Robot 이벤트에서 20개의 사이버캡을 공개하며 $30,000 미만의 가격으로 구입할 수 있다고 밝혔습니다.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t레베카 벨란\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t2시간 전\\n\\n간략히\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFTX의 Ryan Salame은 감옥으로 향하면서 LinkedIn에 농담을 게시합니다.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t아만다 실버링\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t10시간 전\\n\\nAI 최신\\n\\n자세히 보기\\n\\n앱\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBabbel 공동 창업자인 Markus Witte가 CEO Arne Schepker를 대신하여 다시 한번 회사를 운영하게 됩니다.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t프레데릭 라르디노이스\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t5시간 전\\n\\n기업\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNumeric은 AI를 사용하여 회계를 자동화하기 위해 2,800만 달러 규모의 Series A를 확보했습니다.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t마리나 템킨\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t15시간 전\\n\\n간략히\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t누군가 AI를 사용해 2,843개의 일자리에 지원했다고 주장합니다.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t기자는 AI를 이용해 2,843개 일자리에 지원했다.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t카일 위거스\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t16시간 전\""
